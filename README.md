# firstwebsite

My first ever website made years ago in 9th or 10th grade
I don't remember writing any of the css, html and the main js was borrowed from an online source and then reconfigured to match my needs
It's a fun memory to see when I first developed websites, did not make any websites between this and the other web dev project
